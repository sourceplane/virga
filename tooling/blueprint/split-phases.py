"""Derive one blueprint per phase from a phased monolithic Blueprint.

  Usage:  python3 tooling/blueprint/split-phases.py repo-blueprint.yaml flows/phases

  Regenerate the phase blueprints after editing repo-blueprint.yaml (the
  baseline as a Blueprint of itself). Known phase names are written to
  flows/phases/<NN-folder>/blueprint.yaml, co-located with each phase's
  workflow and README.

Why this is not just a file split:

  * `dependsOn` an undeclared module is a hard validation error, so every
    cross-phase edge must be pruned. That is safe precisely BECAUSE the phases
    are run in order — the barrier the monolith enforced declaratively becomes
    the run sequence.
  * Hooks need the complete tree (rebrand enumerates via `git ls-files`), so
    only the final phase carries `hooks.postInstantiate`.
  * `inputs`, `sources` and `ignore` are replicated verbatim into every phase:
    each run resolves the baseline independently and must ignore the same
    build artifacts.
