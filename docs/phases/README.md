# The phases — one blueprint, eight selections

`repo-blueprint.yaml` declares eight phases that take a website from
**nothing** to a **live, documented baseline**. Run them one at a time at your
own pace with `--phase <name>`, or the whole sequence unattended with
`--resume`. There is no umbrella workflow and no per-phase blueprint: a phase
is a selection on one artifact, which is what makes running one alone, months
later, from a fresh container the same operation as running them all.

Each phase follows the same contract:

> **place its modules → land them as a PR (merged immediately — the
> convergence is the gate) → watch the deployment convergence (auto-resumed)
> → verify it is actually deployed.**

Run from the baseline checkout (the blueprint's source is `path: .`); the
product repo is wherever `--out` points.

## Execution order

The phase number is the EXECUTION order — the root scaffold must exist before
anything else can build or deploy. Each phase's `requires.phases` states this
in the document, and the engine refuses a phase whose predecessor is not
placed, naming it.

| phase | lands | verified by |
|---|---|---|
| [`01-scaffold`](01-scaffold.md) | **GitHub repo created** + repo born: intent, CI, tooling, identity | repo pushed + workspace-linked |
| [`02-foundation`](02-foundation.md) | the five shared packages | verify lanes green |
| [`03-infrastructure`](03-infrastructure.md) | d1, kv | published `WIRING_*` secrets |
| [`04-mail`](04-mail.md) | db-migrate + the internal mail Worker | convergence green |
| [`05-api`](05-api.md) | site-api, the one public Worker | `/health` 200 on stage+prod |
| [`06-site`](06-site.md) | the Next.js site on Workers + Static Assets | site answers on stage+prod |
| [`07-domain`](07-domain.md) | custom domain (OPTIONAL — `when: inputs.domain`) | convergence green |
| [`08-docs`](08-docs.md) | live-deployment docs (manifest + operating contract) | committed manifest matches probed reality |

### Why there is no `-restore` phase

Cirrus, the baseline Virga came from, strips its Workers' service bindings for
one landing and puts them back in the next. It has to: its fleet's bindings are
cyclic, a Worker cannot deploy against a service that does not exist yet, and
in a cycle none of them can go first.

Virga has exactly one binding — `site-api` → `MAIL_WORKER` — and it points
backwards. `04-mail` lands the mail Worker; `05-api` lands the site API against
it. A one-directional edge needs no cycle broken, so there is no
`cycle-break` step and no second worker landing. Keep it that way: a second
binding that points forward would put the cycle back, and the phase order is
the only thing currently preventing it.

## Inputs

`01-scaffold` takes the product identity once and writes it into the repo
(`.rebrand/values.json`); every later phase reads it back from the placed tree.
But the blueprint's **required** inputs — `repoName`, `productName`,
`productDomain`, `githubOrg` — are validated before any phase runs, so they
must be supplied on every invocation, single-phase ones included. A `--values`
file is easier than repeating `--set`.

- `orunWorkspace` — workspace id (`ws_…`). Unset, it is the workspace the build
  runs in (`from: workspace`); with none anywhere, a placeholder that fails
  loudly rather than silently cross-tenanting.
- `epicSlug` (default `site-baselining`) — the epic every phase clubs its task
  under. Found by slug, so a fresh run and a resumed run find the same work.
- `domain` (default `false`) — whether to run `07-domain`. It needs the
  Cloudflare zone to already exist, so it is off unless asked for; the phase
  carries the condition as its own `when:`.
- `repoPrivate` (default `true`) — the product repo's visibility. Asked rather
  than assumed.

```bash
orun new --blueprint repo-blueprint.yaml \
  --out $HOME/sourceplane/acme-blog --run-hooks --phase 03-infrastructure \
  --values ~/acme-blog.values.yaml
```

Drop `--run-hooks` (or add `--status`) to preview. Without it a phase places
files and stops: no repo, no landing, no convergence watch, and no probe —
which is exactly what makes a dry instantiation of this baseline possible in
CI with no workspace and no provider.

## Headless / container mode

A fresh container with two env tokens is the entire contract (see
[BOOTSTRAP.md](../../BOOTSTRAP.md)). Clone the baseline at a tag and the tag
pins everything: the blueprint, its modules, and the scripts its hooks run all
come from that one commit.

```bash
export ORUN_TOKEN=… GITHUB_TOKEN=…
git clone --depth 1 --branch <baseline-tag> https://github.com/sourceplane/virga
cd virga
orun new --blueprint repo-blueprint.yaml --out /work/acme-blog --run-hooks \
  --phase 03-infrastructure --values /work/acme-blog.values.yaml
```

## Unattended: `--resume`

`--resume` places every phase not already derived as done, in dependency
order, honouring each barrier. Expected wall-clock on a clean run: **~45
minutes** (see [TIMINGS.md](TIMINGS.md) — and note which of those numbers are
still estimates).

Why it can run unattended:

- **Idempotence, everywhere.** Landings and the convergence watch fall back to
  plain REST when `gh` is degraded, smokes retry route propagation, and
  `orun.run/watch@v1` auto-resumes failed lanes ×3 (`resumeBudget: 3`). A
  phase that failed partway resumes by simply being re-run.
- **Waits are declared, not slept.** `03-infrastructure` waits on the provider
  consent through `orun.doctor/check@v1` (up to 10 minutes), and `04-mail`
  will not start until `orun.secrets/exists@v1` finds both `WIRING_*` keys. A
  consent nobody has clicked is a *wait*, not a failure.
- **Verification is the phase's own last act.** `await` hooks re-probe the live
  endpoints and re-list the published secrets, trusting no earlier step's word.

## Pacing, idempotence, resume

- Run one phase today and the next whenever. Nothing expires between phases;
  each phase re-derives its own preconditions.
- **Phase state is derived from the tree, never stored.** Nothing in `--out`
  records which phases have run. A stored file would be a cache, and it must
  always be safe to delete.
- A phase whose files are all present but differ from the blueprint derives as
  **`drifted`** — which is every phase once `01-scaffold` brands the tree.
  Drift SATISFIES a successor's requirement (the files are all there), and
  `--resume` leaves a drifted phase placed rather than reverting your product's
  identity to `virga`. Re-place one deliberately with `--phase <name>`.
- **A re-run phase always has something to land.** A convergence can fail
  AFTER its PR merged, and the merge has already put every file the phase
  places on main — so a plain re-run finds nothing to commit, and the product's
  CI (`orun plan --changed`) redeploys nothing. Re-run the phase and its
  `retouch` hook (`tooling/bootstrap/retouch.mjs`) rewrites
  `# orun: redeploy <phase> <stamp>` as the last line of each affected
  `component.yaml`, so the landing has a diff and exactly the phase's
  components redeploy. The line is a deploy trigger, never state: nothing reads
  it back, and the invariant above holds.

## Prerequisites (once)

1. `orun auth login --device`.
2. A workspace for the product; note its `ws_…` id.
3. The two integrations connected in that workspace — GitHub (on the account
   that will OWN the repo) and Cloudflare. `03-infrastructure` POLLS for these
   up to 10 minutes, so you can click the consent while it waits.
4. An **admin-role** API key. The first credential WRITE is
   `03-infrastructure`'s secret reconcile: a builder/viewer key gets through
   `01-scaffold` and `02-foundation` and dies at phase three.

## The mechanism, as typed actions

Everything the phases do that is not placing files is a **typed action** — a
closed registry inside the orun binary, not a script this repo ships:

| action | role |
|---|---|
| `orun.task/ensure@v1` | the phase's own task: find-or-create by identity under `epicSlug`, contract attached from `tasks/<phase>.TaskContract.yaml`. Never blocks a landing |
| `orun.repo/ensure@v1` | create the product repo under `githubOrg` if it does not exist (pre-created is supported) |
| `orun.pr/land@v1` | commit → branch → PR → wait for checks → merge → back on main, through the provenance pen so the landing binds to the phase's task |
| `orun.run/watch@v1` | wait for the main convergence run; auto-resume through transient failures |
| `orun.doctor/check@v1` | the provider-consent wait — a precondition, not a preamble |
| `orun.secrets/exists@v1` | assert the keys a later phase reads are published |
| `orun.integrations/reconcile@v1` | bring the brokered provider secrets to their declared state: keys that exist are KEPT, missing ones are minted against the ACTIVE connection. It never holds a value |
| `orun.http/probe@v1` | probe the live `/health` and site URLs |

The hooks that still `run:` a command are the ones that are this baseline's own
business rather than a verb any bootstrap needs: git init / stage / restage and
`pnpm install --lockfile-only` in `01-scaffold`,
`tooling/rebrand/rebrand.mjs` (the identity rename, then `--verify`),
`tooling/bootstrap/retouch.mjs` (the redeploy marker every deploying phase
writes before it lands), and `hooks/render-deployment-docs.sh` (`08-docs`'s
renderer). Each resolves the baseline checkout as `{{ .baseline.dir }}`, so a
pinned clone pins them too.

## Tracking the bootstrap as work

The whole programme is on the plane before the first phase places a file: the
blueprint's run-level `hooks.preInstantiate` list (orun ≥ v2.60) opens the
`epicSlug` epic with its description, one milestone per phase in phase order
with the phase's verify assertions as exit criteria, and one task per landing —
so a reader can open the epic while `01-scaffold` is still creating the
repository. Every phase's `pre` hook is then an `orun.task/ensure@v1` on its
own task: the same identity, so it finds rather than creates, and yields the key
its landing binds the pull request to.

`gates: []` in every contract is a declaration: merge alone finishes the task,
because the main convergence is the gate the phase *watches*, not one the plane
observes as a PR check. The contract templates in `tasks/` are baseline
machinery, never product content — `testing/leak.test.sh` fails if one ships.
