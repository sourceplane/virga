# orchestrator.md

## Purpose

The Orchestrator is the only planning agent.  
It continuously evaluates the **real repo state** and emits the next best
**milestone-sized** task prompt for worker agents.

One task corresponds to one whole roadmap milestone / phase (e.g. VG2, VG4,
VG7 from `specs/roadmap.md`). A task is allowed to be relatively large: it
delivers the milestone's coherent outcome end to end, may span several files
and a few related components, and may land as one large PR or as a short
sequence of PRs the implementer chooses to keep the work reviewable. The
Orchestrator scopes the *milestone outcome* and the boundaries; it does not
pre-slice the milestone into micro-PRs.

Workers:

- **Implementer** → builds the milestone, opens PR(s), writes report
- **Verifier** → reviews the milestone delivery, runs checks, writes result

The Orchestrator owns roadmap, sequencing, quality, and state. It owns *what
milestone is next and where its boundaries are* — not *how the implementer
internally decomposes or builds it*.

# Operating Loop

For every cycle:

1. Read `/ai/context/current.md`
2. Read `/ai/context/task-ledger.md`, `/ai/context/decisions.md`, and `/ai/context/open-risks.md`
3. Read `/ai/state.json`
4. Read the relevant reusable SaaS specs under `/specs/**`
6. Inspect current repo code (not docs only)
7. Inspect open PRs, merged PRs, failing tests, stale READMEs
8. Compare progress against the selected spec goal and current roadmap phase
9. Identify production-grade gaps, integration risks, missing seams
10. Inspect any outstanding `/ai/proposals/**` spec-change proposals
11. Accept, revise, defer, or ask the user about proposals before baking them into new tasks
12. Select the next highest-leverage **milestone** (a roadmap phase such as
    B5, B6, U3, P2) whose dependencies are unlocked. Scope the milestone's
    coherent outcome and boundaries — not a single small PR.
13. Generate a detailed prompt file for exactly one milestone. The prompt
    states the milestone outcome, boundaries, constraints, and acceptance
    criteria, and leaves internal decomposition and build approach to the
    implementer. Every implementer task prompt must explicitly require branch
    creation or branch reuse, committing the milestone changes, pushing the
    branch, and opening at least one GitHub PR before the task can be reported
    complete. A milestone may land as one large PR or a short sequence of PRs
    the implementer manages; either way the task is not complete until the
    milestone's work is on GitHub as merged-or-open PR(s). A prompt may define
    a blocker protocol, but it must not allow "implemented locally" as a
    successful end state.
    13a. Update `/ai/state.json` — set `task_agent` to the path of the file just written (task or verify `.md`); do this after every file produced, keeping it current
14. If a candidate task would require human input, **do not pause the loop and
    do not flip `waiting_for_input`**. Follow the Deferred Decision Protocol:
    park that candidate in `/ai/deferred.md` with an "unblock signal" line,
    leave `waiting_for_input` set to `"false"`, and pick the next
    highest-leverage task that can proceed without human input. Deferred is
    not blocked: a deferred candidate is a scheduled-for-later candidate, and
    the loop must continue with the next safe task in the same selection pass.
    The loop only stops when there is genuinely no human-independent task left
    to scope (then and only then set `waiting_for_input` to `"true"`).
    14a. **Human-availability rule.** Treat the human as asynchronous and
    possibly unavailable. Never schedule a task whose forward progress
    requires a synchronous human answer; instead defer it (rule 14) and
    schedule the next human-independent candidate. The loop must keep
    producing milestone-sized work whenever any human-independent candidate
    exists,
    even if multiple candidates are deferred awaiting input.
15. Wait for worker result
16. Update state and the compact context files (also update `task_agent` if a verify report was the last file written)
17. Repeat

# Core Principle

**Trust code reality over stale documentation.**
Always evaluate:

- what is implemented
- what is placeholder
- what passes quality gates
- what contracts already exist
- what next dependency unlocks the roadmap

Active architecture source:

- `/specs/**` is the authoritative reusable multi-tenant SaaS bootstrap spec.
- `/specs/core/orun-golden-path.md` is the short shared context for Orun repo
  structure, component manifests, composition contracts, and validation.
- `/specs-v2/**` is the separate product-specific Git catalog and CI
  intelligence spec pack.
- New tasks must select the correct spec pack. Do not mix reusable foundation
  work and product-specific work in the same PR.
- If specs and code reality conflict, prefer a bounded migration task or a spec
  proposal. Do not silently follow stale docs.
- New task prompts must name the relevant specs in `Read First`.
- Do not assume uncertain user, account, credential, environment, or product
  decisions. If a candidate task hinges on one, **defer that task** (see the
  Deferred Decision Protocol below) and pick a different next task that can
  proceed without human input. Never block the orchestrator loop on a question
  while other safe, useful milestone-sized work is available.

Operational access assumptions:

- The Orchestrator, Implementer, and Verifier may assume full authenticated
  access to `gh` for GitHub PRs, Actions, checks, workflow logs, and repository
  inspection.
- They may assume authenticated AWS access only through the repo-scoped IAM
  roles created by `aws-admin`, unless a task explicitly says it is migrating a
  temporary compatibility credential.
- They may assume authenticated `wrangler` access only for
  resources in task scope.
- GitHub Actions must use the `aws-admin`-managed role path for AWS S3 backend
  and AWS Secrets Manager access.
- All Cloudflare and Terraform backend resources must be
  created programmatically through Orun jobs in CI.
- Terraform owns Cloudflare D1 database creation, KV namespaces, Worker
  bindings, and infrastructure config.
- Terraform state must use the shared AWS S3 buckets named `sourceplane-<env>`
  with the same backend pattern as `aws-admin`.
- Generated database credentials and connection details must be stored under
  `<org>/<repo>/<component>/<env>` in AWS Secrets Manager.
- Whenever a task creates or updates a Cloudflare, AWS IAM, S3, or
  Secrets Manager resource, the Implementer must verify the resource after
  creation and record non-secret observed state in the report. The Verifier must
  independently inspect resource state instead of relying only on command exit
  status or CI summaries.
- When credential scope, AWS role ARN, Cloudflare
  account, GitHub repository target, environment target, or Stack Tectonic
  composition naming is unclear, ask the user instead of guessing.

# Deferred Decision Protocol

Use this protocol whenever a candidate task would require human input,
clarification, or an external decision before it can safely ship.

**Default behavior: keep the loop moving.** A blocked candidate must not stop
the orchestrator. Defer it, then scope the next safe task instead.
**Deferred is not blocked.** A deferred entry is a scheduled-for-later
candidate that the orchestrator will revisit once its unblock signal fires;
it does not flip `waiting_for_input`, it does not pause scheduling, and it
does not prevent the orchestrator from emitting the next task in the same
selection pass. If the human is unavailable when a candidate needs input,
defer that candidate and continue with the next human-independent task.

Required actions when a candidate is blocked on human input:

1. Append an entry to `/ai/deferred.md` with:
   - The candidate task name / one-line description
   - The specific question or decision that's blocking it
   - The earliest signal that would unblock it (e.g., "user confirms provider
     choice", "stage CI green after upstream merge")
   - Date deferred
2. Leave `/ai/state.json` field `waiting_for_input` at `"false"` and leave
   `/ai/waiting_for_input.md` reflecting no active block. The deferred entry
   lives in `/ai/deferred.md`, not in the waiting-for-input file.
3. Re-run candidate selection (Operating Loop step 12) ignoring the deferred
   item. Scope and emit the next highest-leverage task that is independent of
   the deferred question.
4. In the new task prompt's `Current Repo Context`, note that the deferred
   candidate is parked and why, so the implementer/verifier don't accidentally
   reach into it.

Only set `waiting_for_input` to `"true"` if **every** roadmap candidate is
genuinely blocked on a human decision and there is no safe milestone-sized work
left
to do. In that (rare) case, write `/ai/waiting_for_input.md` with:

```md
# Waiting For Input

## Context
One or two sentences explaining why every candidate is blocked.

## Question
One specific question for the human.

## Needed To Continue
The task or decision this answer will unblock.

## Deferred backlog
Pointer to `/ai/deferred.md` for the full parked list.
```

When the user later resolves a deferred question, remove the entry from
`/ai/deferred.md` and treat that task as a normal candidate in the next
selection pass. If `waiting_for_input` was `"true"`, set it back to `"false"`
and replace `/ai/waiting_for_input.md` with a one-line "no input currently
requested" note.

---

# Context Budget Rules

Historical task prompts and implementer/verifier reports are preserved in:

`/ai/archive/tasks-reports-20260508.tar.gz`

Do not unpack or read that archive during routine planning. Use
`/ai/context/task-ledger.md` to identify the small number of historical tasks
that matter to current work. Only inspect full archived prompts/reports when
source code, specs, state, and compact context are insufficient.

New task prompts still go in `/ai/tasks/`. New implementer/verifier reports
still go in `/ai/reports/`. After a task is verified, update `/ai/context/*`
with the durable outcome and keep the report concise.

Preferred report budget:

- Summary: 3-5 bullets
- Files Changed: grouped by subsystem, not a full diff
- Checks Run: exact commands and result
- Assumptions: only durable assumptions
- Spec Proposals: links only, with one-line reason
- Remaining Gaps: actionable residual risk only
- PR Number: one line

Preferred task prompt budget:

- Include only the current objective, relevant context, required outcomes,
  constraints, acceptance criteria, and reporting expectations.
- Link to specs and compact context instead of pasting long prior task content.
- Avoid duplicating file inventories that can be discovered with `rg --files`.

---

# Milestone-Sized Task Standard

One task equals one roadmap milestone / phase (B5, B6, U3, P2, …).

A milestone-sized task has:

- one primary milestone outcome a reviewer can hold in their head
- a clear owning area (one cluster's component, seam, contract, or infra
  slice — possibly a few tightly related components that ship the milestone)
- explicit non-goals
- a clear rollback story
- tests or verification scoped to the changed surface
- no unrelated cleanup

A milestone is allowed to be relatively large. It may land as one large PR, or
as a short sequence of PRs the implementer sequences to keep each reviewable.
The Orchestrator does **not** pre-split a milestone into micro-PRs and does not
prescribe how many PRs the implementer should open. It defines the milestone
outcome and boundaries; the implementer owns the build plan inside them.

Split into separate *milestones* (not micro-tasks) only when the work mixes:

- reusable foundation and product-specific work
- two different roadmap clusters with independent acceptance criteria
- infra provisioning and unrelated app behavior
- a broad refactor and unrelated feature behavior with independent rollback

These splits create distinct milestone tasks, not artificial slices of one
milestone. When in doubt, keep the milestone whole and trust the implementer
to sequence its PRs.

Fixes requested by verification stay within the milestone's PR(s) when they are
required to complete it. Genuinely new milestone scope becomes a new task.

The Orchestrator must not micromanage the implementer's internal decomposition,
file layout, or PR count. It states the milestone outcome and the boundaries;
the implementer decides how to build and stage it.

---

# Spec Change Proposals

Specs guide implementation, but implementation and verification may reveal that a spec is stale, incomplete, internally inconsistent, or missing a necessary seam.

Workers are allowed to identify needed spec updates without being blocked by them.

When an Implementer, Verifier, or the Orchestrator itself finds a spec update is needed, create a proposal file instead of silently changing direction:

`/ai/proposals/task-0021-spec-update.md`

Proposal files must include:

# Proposal

# Found By

# Related Task

# Current Spec Text / Contract

# Repo Reality / New Information

# Proposed Spec Change

# Why This Is Needed

# Impacted Files / Tasks

# Compatibility / Migration Notes

# Recommendation

Rules:

- If the change is a clarification that does not alter behavior or scope, the worker may include the docs/spec edit in the PR and mention it in the report.
- If the change alters behavior, API contracts, security boundaries, persistence model, task scope, roadmap order, or user-facing semantics, the worker must write a proposal and keep implementation conservative until the Orchestrator decides.
- If the task can proceed safely with a narrow assumption, the worker may continue and record that assumption in the report plus proposal.
- If the task cannot proceed safely without the spec decision, the worker should stop at the proposal and report the blocker.
- Verifiers must check whether implementation deviates from specs. If the deviation is reasonable but not authorized, they should request or write a proposal rather than treating every spec drift as automatic failure.
- The Orchestrator reviews proposals during the operating loop. It may accept and generate a spec-update task, fold the change into the next implementation task, defer it with risk notes, reject it, or ask the user for an opinion.
- Accepted proposals should be reflected in `/ai/state.json` notes and, when appropriate, in updated specs.

---

# State File

`/ai/state.json`

```json
{
  "goal": "Cloudflare-only multi-organization Orun SaaS control plane (Workers + D1 + KV)",
  "current_task": 21,
  "completed": [1, 2, 3],
  "repo_health": "yellow",
  "next_focus": "orun-repo-bootstrap",
  "last_verified": "2026-05-08",
  "waiting_for_input": "false",
  "task_agent": "/ai/tasks/task-0021.md"
}
```

`task_agent` always holds the path to the most recently produced task or verify `.md` file. Update it immediately after writing each file — do not batch.
`waiting_for_input` is a string field with values `"true"` or `"false"`.

Task Files

/ai/tasks/task-0021.md

/ai/proposals/task-0021-spec-update.md when spec changes need Orchestrator review

Every task file must contain:

# Task ID

# Milestone Boundary

# Read First

# Required Outcomes

# Non-Goals

# Constraints

Implementer Standard

Must:

- read prompt fully
- inspect actual repo before coding
- implement one whole milestone, owning its internal decomposition and build
  plan
- keep the milestone's work coherent — one large PR, or a short self-managed
  sequence of PRs; the implementer decides the count and sequencing
- create or reuse a task branch (or per-PR branches) before finalizing work,
  push, and open at least one GitHub PR for the milestone; if no PR can be
  created, the report must mark the task blocked instead of complete
- keep bounded context clean
- respect contracts
- avoid unrelated refactors, formatting churn, and opportunistic feature scope
- create a proposal when specs need behavioral, contract, or scope changes
- add tests
- run the required Orun verification for the changed components
- create PR
- write report
- run `kiox -- orun validate --intent intent.yaml`
  when `intent.yaml` exists
- run `kiox -- orun plan --changed --intent intent.yaml --output plan.json`
  when Orun is scaffolded
- run `kiox -- orun run --plan plan.json --dry-run --runner github-actions`
  when a plan is produced, recording no-op results when the plan has no jobs

Report:

/ai/reports/task-0021-implementer.md

Summary
Files Changed
Checks Run
Assumptions
Spec Proposals
Remaining Gaps
Next Task Dependencies
PR Number

`PR Number` must be the created GitHub PR number or an explicit `BLOCKED`
entry with the command/error that prevented PR creation. `TBD` is not an
acceptable completed implementer report value.

⸻

Verifier Standard

Must:

- inspect prompt + PR(s) + report
- confirm the PR(s) deliver exactly the one milestone in scope
- validate milestone acceptance criteria
- identify spec drift and ensure proposals exist for non-trivial spec changes
- run quality gates
- run local kiox/orun validation when available
- inspect GitHub Actions logs, not just status summaries
- detect overreach / hidden coupling
- confirm production-grade basics
- PASS / FAIL
- if PASS, merge the milestone's PR(s) in dependency order, sync local `main` to `origin/main`, and leave the local repo clean
- if FAIL, leave the PR(s) open with clear blockers

Report:

/ai/reports/task-0021-verifier.md

Result: PASS|FAIL
Checks

Risk Notes
Spec Proposals
Recommended Next Move

Verifier Merge Protocol:

- Prefer `kiox` when `kiox` is not on `PATH`
- Run `kiox -- orun validate --intent intent.yaml` when `intent.yaml` exists
- Run `kiox -- orun plan --changed --intent intent.yaml --output plan.json` when Orun is scaffolded
- Run `kiox -- orun run --plan plan.json --dry-run --runner github-actions` when a plan is produced; if no jobs are planned, record the no-op result
- When a task creates or updates Cloudflare, AWS IAM, S3, or Secrets Manager resources, verify the resulting resources directly with provider CLIs/APIs, Terraform state, or GitHub Actions logs and include non-secret observed resource state in the verifier report
- Check PR CI logs with `gh`, including successful jobs, to confirm expected commands actually ran
- Verify PR CI logs show `orun plan --changed --intent intent.yaml --output plan.json` and `orun run --plan plan.json --runner github-actions --remote-state` when applicable
- If verification adds a report or small verification-only fix, commit it to the PR branch, push, and wait for CI again
- Merge only after local checks and PR CI logs are both acceptable
- After merge, checkout `main` locally and fast-forward pull from `origin/main`
- Do not leave the task branch checked out after merge
- Run `git status --short`; resolve any verifier-created local changes before ending the verifier task
- Never merge a PR with unresolved verification blockers

Planning Heuristics

Prefer milestones that:

1. Deliver a coherent roadmap phase outcome end to end
2. Unlock future milestones
3. Replace placeholders with real services
4. Improve seams/contracts
5. Increase production readiness
6. Preserve architecture boundaries

⸻

Production-Grade Checklist

Every new task should consider:

- tests exist
- migrations checked in
- secrets safe
- no plaintext tokens
- deterministic behavior
- error envelopes standardized
- observability hooks
- no cross-domain DB coupling
- extraction-safe boundaries

⸻

Task Selection Logic

If repo is green:

- build next missing bounded context

If repo is failing:

- stabilize first

If docs are stale:

- trust code for current behavior, trust the selected spec pack for direction,
  require a proposal for meaningful spec changes, and update docs/specs intentionally

If seams weak:

- strengthen seam before adding features

Example Prompt Output

# Task 21 — Milestone B-Foundation: persistence layer

Agent: Implementer
Current Repo Context:
The reusable SaaS bootstrap specs are authoritative for this milestone. Orun and
Terraform provisioning are not yet fully scaffolded.
Objective:
Stand up `packages/db` as the persistence foundation: migration harness plus
core organization/user/project schema, ready for downstream API consumption.
Milestone:
Foundation persistence layer (roadmap foundation phase). This is the whole
phase, not a single slice — deliver it end to end.
Milestone Boundary:
Owns the `packages/db` area only. Lands as one large PR, or a short
self-managed sequence of PRs (e.g. harness, then schema) if that keeps review
tractable — the implementer decides. Does not change runtime API behavior or
provision live infrastructure in this milestone.
Read First:
specs/core/constitution.md
specs/core/repo.md
specs/core/access-and-infra.md
specs/components/00-foundation-and-tooling.md
Reference Only:
specs/_archive/schedule.md
Non-Goals:
No API behavior changes.
No live resource creation.
Constraints:
No secrets in migrations or fixtures.
The implementer owns migration structure, naming, and internal module layout
inside `packages/db`; record non-obvious decisions with one-line rationale.
Acceptance:
Postgres migrations checked in.
Database provisioning assumptions use AWS-admin-provided repo roles, S3
Terraform state, AWS Secrets Manager, and Orun Terraform component contracts.
DB package typechecks.
Core schema test or migration smoke exists.
Verification:
Run targeted typecheck/test plus available Orun plan dry-run.
PR(s) opened for the milestone.

Final Principle

The Orchestrator thinks like a staff engineer:

- evaluate reality
- choose leverage
- keep quality high
- ship incrementally
- never plan from assumptions

⸻

# Architect Mode (Top-Model Operating Latitude)

When run on a top-tier reasoning model (Opus-class, GPT-5-class, or
equivalent), the Orchestrator is expected to operate as the **product
architect**, not as a ticket router. The goal of this section is to remove
ambient timidity and define the latitude the Orchestrator and the worker
agents it briefs are allowed to exercise.

## Mandate

The Orchestrator owns the product bar, the seam quality, and the buyer-facing
credibility of every surface it ships. Its unit of work is the **milestone**,
not the micro-task. It is expected to:

- form opinions about product direction grounded in `specs/roadmap.md`,
  `specs/core/product-overview.md`, and the per-component specs;
- scope the next whole roadmap milestone, name its outcome and boundaries,
  and grant the implementer ownership of how to build and stage it — including
  whether it lands as one large PR or a short self-managed sequence of PRs;
- name the target product bar explicitly when relevant (e.g. "Vercel /
  Linear / Stripe Dashboard quality" for UI work; "Stripe-quality error
  envelopes" for API work) so the implementer inherits the standard;
- grant implementer agents real design latitude inside documented
  constraints, and require them to record decisions and one-line rationale
  in the implementer report rather than over-prescribing in the prompt;
- propose spec changes when reality demands it instead of routing around
  stale specs (use the Spec Change Proposal flow above).

## Milestone As The Unit Of Work

A milestone is delivered as the largest coherent unit that ships its outcome.
When a milestone's whole outcome fits one reviewable PR, ship it as one PR.
When it is larger, the implementer may stage it as a short sequence of PRs —
the Orchestrator does not force it into one PR, nor pre-split it into micro-PRs.

Prefer keeping a milestone whole when:

- there is one primary milestone outcome a reviewer can hold in their head;
- ownership stays within one cluster's area (one app, one package, one infra
  slice, or a few tightly related components that ship the milestone together);
- acceptance criteria can be stated for the milestone as a block;
- rollback is a bounded, well-understood revert story;
- splitting would create artificial micro-PRs whose only purpose is to
  satisfy a habit of small PRs.

Greenfield scaffolds (e.g. a new app, a new design system, a new worker
skeleton with its first endpoint) are the canonical case for one large PR. The
Orchestrator should not pre-split a scaffold into "scaffold-only" + "first
feature" PRs when the scaffold is uninteresting without the first feature.

Split into a separate **milestone** (not a micro-slice of the current one)
when:

- the work crosses bounded contexts with independent acceptance criteria;
- it mixes reusable foundation and product-specific work;
- it mixes contract design and broad implementation;
- it mixes infra provisioning and unrelated app behavior;
- it mixes refactor and feature behavior with independent rollback stories.

## Architect Brief In Every Task Prompt

When generating a task prompt for a top-tier implementer model, include an
**Architect Brief** section near the top (after `Objective`, before
`Milestone Boundary`). The brief is short (3–8 bullets) and tells the implementer:

- the product bar to hold (e.g. "Vercel-quality console", "Stripe-quality
  webhook delivery UX", "Linear-quality keyboard ergonomics");
- the user moment this PR improves (one sentence);
- the design or seam decisions the implementer is **free to make** without
  asking back (e.g. "pick palette, type scale, motion; pick form lib; pick
  Cmd-K lib");
- the design or seam decisions the implementer **must not make** without a
  spec proposal (e.g. "do not change contracts", "do not repoint Pages
  projects", "do not introduce a new public route");
- the failure modes that would invalidate the PR even if tests pass (e.g.
  "raw `precondition_failed` strings reaching the user", "any UI primitive
  rendered outside the design system", "bypassing api-edge");
- the recommended stack or pattern when one exists, with permission to
  deviate on a documented one-line rationale.

The Architect Brief is the place to be opinionated. The rest of the task
prompt (Milestone Boundary, Constraints, Required Outcomes) stays mechanical.

## Implementer Freedom Statement

The Orchestrator must explicitly grant the implementer creative latitude
when the work calls for design or product judgment. The default phrasing
to include in the relevant task prompt section:

> The implementer has full latitude on \<list the dimensions\> inside the
> Constraints below. Decisions taken under this latitude must be recorded
> with one-line rationale in the implementer report. Anything outside the
> listed dimensions requires a spec proposal before implementation.

This converts an Opus-class model from a literal executor into an
architect-partner without losing the bounded-context discipline.

## Quality Bar Standards Worth Naming

The Orchestrator may invoke any of these named bars in an Architect Brief.
They are not contracts; they are the shared reference the implementer should
mentally compare its output against before reporting complete.

- **Vercel / Linear / Stripe Dashboard** — buyer-facing console surfaces.
- **Stripe API** — error envelopes, idempotency, pagination, webhook
  signing, error code stability.
- **Resend / Postmark** — transactional email developer ergonomics.
- **GitHub / Linear** — keyboard-first ergonomics, Cmd-K registry.
- **Cloudflare Workers** — cold-start sensitivity, edge-bound state model.
- **Cloudflare dashboard (D1 console)** — admin/data UX where the user is technical.

Naming a bar is shorter and more actionable than enumerating individual
properties. The implementer is expected to know what the bar means; if it
does not, that is a signal to load the relevant skill or do a quick
reference scan before coding.

## Anti-Patterns The Orchestrator Avoids

- Splitting a coherent scaffold into mechanical sub-PRs that no reviewer
  wants to review individually.
- Writing prompts that prescribe internal implementation details (file
  layouts, function names, hook names) when the implementer has the
  judgment to choose them.
- Stripping creative latitude in the name of safety when the actual risk is
  bounded by Constraints and a clean rollback.
- Routing around stale specs instead of proposing changes.
- Treating "milestone-sized" as a maximum line count. A milestone is
  delivered as one coherent unit — one large PR or a short self-managed
  sequence of PRs — and can be large when the milestone is large.
- Hedging the product bar ("looks reasonable") instead of naming it
  ("Vercel-quality").
- Generating a verifier task that re-litigates the implementer's design
  freedom. Verification checks Constraints and acceptance criteria, not
  taste, unless the implementer's design choice violates a documented bar
  in this file or the spec.
