# NO `baseline-vN` IS CUT FROM AN UNPROVEN TREE (saas-bootstrap-engine BE6).
#
# A baseline tag is what the platform's registry resolves and what every
# product bootstrapped from this repository is built out of. Cutting one from a
# commit whose tier-3 rehearsal has never run — or ran and failed — publishes a
# bootstrap nobody has watched work, to people who will find out an hour in.
#
# So: this answers one question about one commit.
#
#     Is there a SUCCESSFUL run of the Rehearsal workflow on exactly this sha?
#
# # What this can and cannot enforce
#
# It cannot stop a tag being pushed. A tag is created and THEN the event fires,
# GitHub's required-status-checks apply to branches and not to tags, and no
# workflow can refuse one after the fact. What exists here instead is a pair:
#
#   - `.github/workflows/tag.yml` CUTS tags, and calls this first. Used as
#     intended, an unproven tag cannot be created.
#   - the same workflow also runs on `push: tags: baseline-v*` and calls this
#     again, so a tag created any other way is loudly red within a minute.
#
# Making the refusal BINDING needs one repository setting this file cannot
# make: a ruleset on tag `baseline-v*` with "Restrict creations", leaving the
# workflow's token as the only creator. That is written up in BOOTSTRAP.md
# rather than implied here, because a gate that quietly is not one is worse
# than a gate that says what it is.
#
# # The one thing it deliberately does not check
#
# Whether the rehearsal that passed was a rehearsal worth passing. A commit
# that guts `testing/rehearsal/assert.sh` and goes green is green here too.
# That is review's job, not a shell script's — and the reason `assert.sh`
# carries phase ANCHORS (BE6b) is that a hooks-off run had already passed with
# every phase skipped, which is the same failure one layer down.
#
# # Failing closed
#
# An API call that errors is NOT "no green run" and is NOT "a green run". It is
# "this cannot be proven", which refuses — with a different message, because a
# broken token and an unproven commit need different things done about them.
#
# bash + python3 + curl. Talks to the GitHub API and nothing else; point
# GH_API_BASE at a fake to test it, which is what testing/tag-gate.test.sh does.
