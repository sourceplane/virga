# A RE-RUN PHASE HAS SOMETHING TO LAND.
#
# A phase's convergence can fail AFTER its PR merged, and the merge has already
# put every file the phase places on main. orun derives phase state from the
# files, so a retried build sees the phase placed and a forced re-run of it
# lands an EMPTY diff — and the product's CI plans `--changed`, so a component
# whose files did not change in the push does not deploy. The phase's `retouch`
# hook (tooling/bootstrap/retouch.mjs) is what breaks that: one marker line at
# the end of each affected component.yaml,
#
#     # orun: redeploy <phase> <stamp>
#
# replaced rather than accumulated, so the landing has a diff and exactly the
# phase's components are in the changed set. The marker is a deploy trigger and
# nothing reads it back; phase state stays derived, never stored.
#
# This drives the real retouch.mjs over a two-component tree, then checks that
# every component the blueprint's retouch hooks name resolves in THIS tree —
# the layout a product is placed with.
# Needs: node. No network.
