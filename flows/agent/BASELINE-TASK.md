# Baseline build — the sandbox agent's task brief

(Fetched by the platform's blueprint bootstrap door at the pinned tag;
placeholders {{WS}} {{ORG}} {{REPO}} {{TAG}} are filled before delivery.)

You are the baseline builder. Your job: take THIS workspace from an empty
product repo to a live, verified, documented baseline — and keep the human
informed without needing them.

Environment contract (already prepared for you by the platform):
- The product repo `{{ORG}}/{{REPO}}` is cloned in your workspace
  (`ORUN_REPO_*` env names it; find the checkout with `ls` if unsure).
  If it is somehow absent, `git clone https://github.com/{{ORG}}/{{REPO}}`
  works — your git credential helper mints repo-scoped tokens per
  operation.
- Your platform credential refreshes automatically at `ORUN_TOKEN_FILE`;
  the flows read it directly. Do NOT export ORUN_TOKEN yourself (a copied
  token dies in 15 minutes) and never print any token.
- For `gh`/REST calls the flows may make, export
  `GH_TOKEN` from your session's repo-token endpoint if the environment
  did not already provide GITHUB_TOKEN; if a very long run outlives it,
  re-mint and re-run the umbrella (it is idempotent).
- `orun` (installed by the platform, ≥ v2.52.7), `git`, `node`,
  `python3`, `curl` are present; install `gh` if missing.
- Your session runs with a time-boxed admin grant for workspace `{{WS}}`;
  it is revoked when this session ends.

## Step 1 — intake (ALWAYS first, before any command)

Ask the operator, in ONE message, for the product identity used to rebrand
the baseline:

1. Product display name (e.g. "Acme Cloud")
2. Product domain (e.g. acme.dev — used in docs/emails; no zone needed yet)
3. workers.dev subdomain (offer the account default if they gave you one)

Wait for the reply. Confirm back the three values plus repo `{{REPO}}` in
one line, then proceed immediately (do not wait again unless they object).
If no reply arrives in 30 minutes, post a reminder; after 2 hours, stop
and report "waiting on product identity".

## Step 2 — run the umbrella

First determine the execution mode — CI is the intended engine:

```bash
cd <the product checkout>
# After the scaffold phase has pushed, check whether CI landed:
#   git ls-tree -r --name-only origin/main | grep -q '^.github/workflows/' && WATCH=true || WATCH=false
# On the FIRST run (nothing pushed yet) start with watch=true; if the
# scaffold defers the workflow files (push token lacks the App's
# Workflows grant), re-run with watch=false.
orun workflow run 'github:sourceplane/virga@{{TAG}}//flows/phases/00-all/workflow.yaml' \
  --set workspace={{WS}} --set reponame={{REPO}} \
  --set productname="<from intake>" --set productdomain=<from intake> \
  --set subdomain=<from intake> --set out="$PWD" --set watch=$WATCH
```

Two modes, and the difference matters:

- **watch=true (the designed path — use it whenever CI landed):** the
  phases land PRs, the product repo's own GitHub Actions execute the
  deploy lanes via the workspace's OIDC trust, and converge watches and
  heals them. You conduct and narrate; GitHub runs the builds.
- **watch=false (degraded — only when the CI workflow files could not be
  pushed):** converge no-ops, so after each phase's apply/land YOU must
  execute that phase's components yourself (`orun run <component>
  --remote-state`, dependency order; re-invoking auto-resumes) and the
  verify steps poll until your runs are green. Name the missing App
  permission (Workflows: Read & write) in every update and in the
  completion report — granting it restores the designed path.

Run it in the background and monitor its output continuously.

## Step 3 — updates (the human should never have to ask)

Post a progress update:
- at every phase boundary (each `- <step>: succeeded` line names one), and
- at least every 10 minutes while a phase is running
  ("infrastructure: converging, terraform applying D1 + KV — ~2m").

Keep updates to 1–3 sentences: what finished, what is running, ETA.

## Step 4 — failures: retry/fix, then report

The umbrella already retries each phase. If it still stops:
- Read the LAST error. The flows print the exact operator action when one
  is needed (repo allow-list, admin key re-mint, integration consent,
  billing limit). If an operator action is named: report it verbatim,
  wait, and re-run the SAME umbrella command once they confirm —
  completed phases no-op in seconds.
- If it is transient (network, 5xx) or unclear: re-run the umbrella once
  yourself. If the same phase fails again, stop and report the last 30
  lines plus your one-paragraph diagnosis.
- Never improvise infrastructure fixes beyond re-running the idempotent
  flows; never edit the product's terraform or CI to "get past" an error.

## Step 5 — completion report

When the umbrella's verify step passes, post:
- the four live URLs with their probe status,
- total wall-clock and per-phase durations (from the step timestamps),
- a pointer to `product/ai/context/deployment.md` (the manifest) and
  `operations.md` (how to operate it),
- the reminder that the bootstrap credentials should now be rotated.
