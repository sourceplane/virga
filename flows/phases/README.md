# Phased bootstrap — one workflow per phase

Eight independent workflows that take a product from **nothing** to a
**live, documented baseline** — run them one at a time at your own pace,
or run [`00-all`](00-all/README.md), the umbrella that executes the whole
sequence unattended (per-phase retry, built-in waits, independent final
verification). Each
phase is self-contained and follows the same contract:

> **apply its blueprint slice → land it as a PR (merged immediately —
> the convergence is the gate) → watch the deployment convergence
> (auto-resumed) → verify it is actually deployed.**

Run every workflow **from the baseline checkout** (the blueprints live
here); the product repo is wherever `out` points.

## Execution order

The phase number is the EXECUTION order — the root scaffold (phase 01,
historically the "workspace" blueprint) must exist before anything else
can build or deploy:

Each phase folder is fully self-contained: `README.md` + `workflow.yaml`
+ its `blueprint.yaml` (the slice it applies).

| # | folder | lands | verified by |
|---|--------|-------|-------------|
| 00 | [`00-all`](00-all/README.md) | **everything below, unattended** (umbrella: retry per phase + early cred probe + independent final verify) | its own end-to-end re-assertion |
| 01 | [`01-scaffold`](01-scaffold/README.md) | **GitHub repo created** + repo born: intent, CI, flows, tooling, identity | repo pushed + workspace-linked |
| 02 | [`02-foundation`](02-foundation/README.md) | the shared packages (contracts, db, shared, testing, cli) + their suites | verify lanes green |
| 03 | [`03-infrastructure`](03-infrastructure/README.md) | d1, kv, db-migrate | published `WIRING_*` secrets |
| 04 | [`04-mail`](04-mail/README.md) | mail-worker (ONE landing — the worker graph is acyclic) | convergence green |
| 05 | [`05-api`](05-api/README.md) | site-api | `/health` 200 on stage+prod |
| 06 | [`06-site`](06-site/README.md) | the web site | site + site-api live |
| 07 | [`07-domain`](07-domain/README.md) | custom domain (OPTIONAL) | convergence green |
| 08 | [`08-docs`](08-docs/README.md) | live-deployment docs (manifest + operating contract) | committed manifest matches probed reality |

## Inputs

Phase 01 takes the product identity once and writes it into the repo
(`.rebrand/values.json`). Every later phase reads it back and needs only:

- `out` — absolute path of the product repo
- `workspace` — workspace id (`ws_…`) or slug
- `dryrun` — `"true"` previews the phase with zero side effects (the
  blueprint is applied in the working tree, shown, and reverted; no PR, no
  deploy, nothing pushed)

```bash
orun workflow run flows/phases/03-infrastructure/workflow.yaml \
  --set out=$HOME/sourceplane/acme --set workspace=ws_… [--set dryrun=true]
```

## Headless / container mode

Each workflow also runs from ANYWHERE by remote reference — a fresh
container with two env tokens is the entire contract (see
[BOOTSTRAP.md §3c](../../BOOTSTRAP.md)):

```bash
export ORUN_TOKEN=… GITHUB_TOKEN=…
orun workflow run github:sourceplane/virga@<ref>//flows/phases/03-infrastructure/workflow.yaml \
  --set workspace=ws_… --set repo=sourceplane/acme
```

The flow fetches the baseline at the SAME commit it was fetched from
(`ORUN_FLOW_SOURCE_SHA`) and clones the product repo (`repo` input) — one
reference pins everything. Inside a baseline checkout the same workflows
keep using the local tree and your `out` path: the two modes are the same
files.

## Pacing, idempotence, resume

- Run one phase today and the next whenever. Nothing expires between
  phases; each phase's preflight re-verifies workspace readiness.
- Every phase is **idempotent**: re-running a completed phase re-applies
  the blueprint (additive, no-op on unchanged files), finds nothing to
  land, and re-verifies. A phase that failed partway resumes by simply
  re-running it.
- A convergence that trips on something transient self-heals:
  `common/converge.sh` resumes the run (`gh run rerun --failed` — CI is
  exec-id + `--retry` resume-capable) up to 3 times before failing.

## Prerequisites (once)

1. `orun auth login --device` (approve at app.orun.dev/cli/device).
2. A workspace for the product; note its `ws_…` id.
3. The two integrations connected in that workspace — GitHub and
   Cloudflare. Deploy phases (03+) POLL for these up to 10 minutes, so
   you can click the consent while preflight waits.

## Shared machinery (`flows/common/`)

| script | role |
|---|---|
| `preflight.sh` | auth → authoritative integrations probe → 10m poll for the three connections → repo allow-list, self-healing via `orun cloud link` |
| `apply-blueprint.sh` | apply one blueprint slice into the product repo, rebrand it (identity from `.rebrand/values.json`), archive phase provenance; enforces a clean tree; `dryrun` shows + reverts |
| `land-pr.sh` | commit → branch → PR → wait for checks (passes when the repo has none yet) → merge (admin bypass when available) → back on main |
| `converge.sh` | wait for the main convergence run; auto-resume through transient failures |
| `verify-endpoints.sh` | probe site-api `/health` / console URLs, derived from `.rebrand/values.json` |
| `create-secrets.sh` | the five brokered provider secrets; idempotent, self-heals orphans |

## Where the blueprints live

Each phase folder carries its own `blueprint.yaml` — the slice it applies.
They are derived from the baseline's monolithic `repo-blueprint.yaml`
(Virga as a Blueprint of itself); regenerate them after editing it:

```bash
python3 tooling/blueprint/split-phases.py repo-blueprint.yaml flows/phases
```

The split prunes cross-phase `dependsOn` edges (ordering becomes the run
sequence), keeps hooks on the scaffold phase only, and re-bases each
blueprint's dir source relative to its own folder.
